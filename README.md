# fin_tech_assessment

## How to Run:
### Assumptions:
- python 3.8+ installed
- requirements.txt installed
- `cd` into base directory
- `python app/BookAnalyzer.py 200`
## Improvements with more time: 
- dockerize script to allow this to be set up on any environment since it would be self contained, this project was set up to facilitate a shift to containers
- strongly type function arguements better (pandas objects mainly)
